# Personnel / Client Retention Study  
## Abstract  
This project examines Personnel Retention in a given institution.  
The goal is to determine the most revelant parameters, how they influence the retention of personnel and a formulation of plan of action.  
Through Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learniung Binary Classification Algorithm, some interesting insights were extracted.  
This project has valuable application to the subject of client retention.  
## 1. Introduction
This project arose from the need of a certain institution to increase it's personnel retention power.  
Employers where leaving the institution and following seemingly random patterns, from resigning after being moved to a position of desire, to resigning soon after promotion.  
To solve this problem, several ideas came to light, from mouth to mouth inquiries to full statistical inquiries. Both of the methods have one common problem, the subjectivity of individuals feedback/answers.  
Having in mind that numbers and data don't lie, it was decided to conduct a more analytical study of the situation through data analysis and Machine Learning Methods. It is here that this project's role came to life.  
## 2. Methodology  
### 2.1. The Data  
The data was sampled from personal files of each indivudual that worked in the institution.  
For the sake of data sensitivity, all parameters were changed to P1, P2 and so on as well as some values for these parameters, but the process retains it's global application.
### 2.2. The Code  
The code lies in the ipynb file that I invite you to read.  
## 4. Conclusion  
With this project we have now the following:  
 - Information on the most relevant parameters in personnel retention which can be used to formulate a plan of action to increase retention power,  
 - Classification algorithm that can return the probability of an individual leaving the organization.  

The organization for which this project was developed gained the information to allow them to increase their retention power and an algorithm to allow for prediction. With this information and tool, a strategy can be developed and implemented to improve the effectiveness of the organization.  
## 5. Final Thoughts  
This approach has great value in improving personnel retention not only in the organization for which it was developed, but also for any organization. When we speak of personnel retention, we also speak to client retention which has great application in many industries.
